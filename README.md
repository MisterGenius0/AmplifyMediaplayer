# Amplifying Mediaplayer
<br/>

This is a music app that I have worked on in my free time.

Its goal is to host an organized version of a music library in a fun and intuitive interface

<br/>

**How to use:**
1. download the latest Windows download on GitHub
2. run the EXE
3. press the "+" (add source) button
4. Link to a folder with music for example you can select the music folder in windows
5. it will find music in the folder and organize it automatically **(NOTE: currently there is no loading or auto refresh when it's done, wait a minute or 2 then restart the app)**
6. you should see your music organized into groups.
7. click on the square to play the song by shuffle or play from the start
8. enjoy :)

<br/>

**Known issues:**
1. The app doesn't refresh automatically after searching for media (you need to restart the app to update the interface)
2. The refresh button doesn't do anything
